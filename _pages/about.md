Welcome! I am a recent PhD from the Department of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley and a Post-Doctoral Fellow at the Center for Global Development. My research interests are at the intersection of development and labor economics, with a particular focus on issues of educational access in low-income settings. To study these topics, I collaborate with local stakeholders to design and implement field experiments. 

Prior to my PhD, I obtained a B.A. in Economics (Honors) from the University of California, Berkeley, and worked as a Research Assistant in the Applied Microeconomics group at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
