Welcome! I am an Associate Economist at RAND Corporation. My research focuses on access to education and human capital investment in low-income settings. To study this, I've collaborated with local stakeholders to design and implement field experiments in Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, and Nigeria. I have a PhD and BA in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley, and  completed a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the Center for Global Development.
