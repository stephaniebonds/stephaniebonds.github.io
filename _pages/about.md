Welcome! I am an Associate Economist at RAND Corporation. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022 and previously was a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Global Development. 
<br/>
<br/>
My research interests are at the intersection of development and labor economics, with a particular focus on issues of educational access in low-income settings.
