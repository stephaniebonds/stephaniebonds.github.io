I am a PhD Candidate in Economics at UC Berkeley. I work on topics in development, labor, and education economics, with a particular interest in access to education in low-income contexts. 

Previously, I worked as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and received a B.A. in Economics from UC Berkeley.
