Welcome! I am an Associate Economist at RAND Corporation. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022 and completed a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Global Development. 
<br/>
<br/>
My research is in development economics, labor economics, and the economics of education, with a focus on issues of educational access in low-income settings and for vulnerable populations. Prior to my PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant in the Applied Microeconomics group at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and completed a BA in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley.
