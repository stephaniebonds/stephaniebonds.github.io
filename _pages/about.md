Welcome! I am a Ph.D. Candidate in the Department of Economics at UC Berkeley. I work on topics in development, labor, and education economics, with a particular interest in access to education in low-income countries. Before graduate school, I received a B.A. in Economics from UC Berkeley and worked as a Research Assistant at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.

*I am on the job market this year and will be available for interviews around the virtual 2022 AEA/ASSA meeting.*
