Welcome! I am a Post-Doctoral Research Fellow at the Center for Global Development. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022. 
<br/>
<br/>
 My research interests are at the intersection of development and labor economics, with a particular focus on issues of educational access in low-income settings. 
<br/>
<br/>
Prior to her PhD, Stephanie obtained a B.A. in Economics (Honors) from the University of California, Berkeley, and worked as a Research Assistant in the Applied Microeconomics group at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
