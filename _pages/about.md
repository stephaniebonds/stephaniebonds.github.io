Welcome! I am an Associate Economist at RAND. I received my PhD in Economics from the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022, and  completed a Post-Doctoral Research Fellowship at the Center for Global Development in 2022-2023. 

My research focuses on education, health, and human capital investment in low-income settings.
